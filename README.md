A simple system for managing different elections

# Voting Management System

## Overview
The Voting Management System is a full-stack application that allows users to cast votes and view results. It consists of a frontend built with React Native and TypeScript (using Expo Go for development), and a backend built with Node.js and Express. WebSocket is used for real-time updates between the frontend and backend.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```
4. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and run the application.

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Access the application on your mobile device using Expo Go.
- Users can cast their votes through the `HomePage`, and view the results on the `ResultsPage`.
- Real-time updates are enabled via WebSocket for live result tracking.
